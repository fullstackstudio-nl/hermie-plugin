# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Capabilities are listed by the string the app tests
for, because that is what the app tests for — a version number here is for
people.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `context.live` — a context edit made while a chat is open reaches that chat on
  its next turn. Hermes renders a plugin's system prompt section once per
  session and replays the bytes it persisted, and a plugin cannot ask for a
  re-render, so the per-turn hook now carries the change instead: it compares
  the app's `profile.yaml` stamp against the one taken when the section was
  frozen and, when the rendered text has actually changed, sends the new copy
  saying it replaces the frozen one. A cleared context is retracted in words.
  On a turn where nothing changed this costs one `stat` and no read.
